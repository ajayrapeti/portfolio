# Project Screenshots Guide

## 📸 How to Add Your Project Screenshots

I've updated your portfolio to display actual project screenshots instead of the computer emoji icons!

### 📁 Where to Place Your Images

Add your project screenshots to the `public/projects/` folder with these exact names:

1. **careervista.png** - CareerVista AI screenshot
2. **federated-learning.png** - Federated Learning Attendance System screenshot
3. **sensovision.png** - Sensovision screenshot
4. **finance-tracker.png** - Personal Finance Tracker screenshot
5. **dental-segmentation.png** - Dental Image Segmentation screenshot
6. **assignment-portal.png** - Student Assignment Portal screenshot
7. **sentiment-analysis.png** - iPhone Sentiment Analysis screenshot

### 📐 Recommended Image Specifications

- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **Dimensions**: 800x600px or 1200x900px (4:3 ratio works best)
- **File Size**: Keep under 500KB for fast loading
- **Quality**: High quality screenshots showing your project's main interface

### 🎨 Tips for Great Screenshots

1. **Use your project's main dashboard or homepage**
2. **Make sure the UI is clean and readable**
3. **Capture key features or visualizations**
4. **Use browser mockups if you want a professional look**
5. **For data science projects**: Show graphs, charts, or results
6. **For web apps**: Show the main interface or landing page

### 🔄 What Happens If Images Are Missing?

If an image file is not found, the portfolio will automatically fall back to showing the computer emoji icon (💻) as a placeholder, so your site won't break.

### ✨ Example Structure

```
public/
└── projects/
    ├── careervista.png
    ├── federated-learning.png
    ├── sensovision.png
    ├── finance-tracker.png
    ├── dental-segmentation.png
    ├── assignment-portal.png
    └── sentiment-analysis.png
```

### 🎯 Quick Action Steps

1. Take screenshots of all 7 projects
2. Rename them according to the list above
3. Place them in `public/projects/` folder
4. Refresh your browser - images will appear automatically!

### 🖼️ Creating Screenshots

**For Web Projects:**
- Open the live project in your browser
- Press `F12` to open DevTools
- Click the device toolbar icon (or Ctrl+Shift+M)
- Set to a nice resolution (like 1920x1080)
- Take a screenshot

**For Data Science/ML Projects:**
- Capture the main results/output
- Show visualizations, charts, or model performance
- Use Jupyter Notebook outputs
- Show the main interface if it has one

**For GitHub README:**
- If your project has screenshots in the README, you can use those
- Right-click and "Save image as..."
